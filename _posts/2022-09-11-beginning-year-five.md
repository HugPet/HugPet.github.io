Began my fifth year at LTU some weeks back. I'm excited to have started
my final year. 

I am currently reading two courses now, one project course where a group of us
work together with a local company, and another in mobile and distributed
systems.

The project course is a longer course, which will finish after christmas. We
are currently in the planning stages of the project, where we are defining
team roles and overall code architecture. 

For more information, see this [site](https://pepperonit.github.io/blog-site/).

The mobile and distributed systems course is very interesting to me. It 
treats some things which I am already experienced at from my time at Xarepo, 
but there are other things which are totally new to me. In the lab for that
course we are tasked with making a peer-to-peer system based on 
[Kademlia](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf),
something which has been very fun to work with so far. 

In the course we have also discussed orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes, Rancher, 
and Docker. This is something that I would very much become more proficient in, as I 
think it is a valuable skill to have.
