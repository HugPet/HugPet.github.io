This is a continuation of two previous posts. See [part one]({% post_url 2022-05-08-drone-mapping %}) and [part two]({% post_url 2022-06-27-drone-part2 %}).

In part two I wrote about how we submitted our paper to a conference, [UCAmI](https://www.ucami.org/). Some weeks back we got the 
news that we were accepted as a long paper! A long paper is defined by UCAmI:

> Intended to allow presentation of academic research results of high quality. Submissions must contain an original contribution and may not have already been published in another forum, nor be subject to review for other conferences or publications. Contributions should include unpublished results of research, case studies or experiences that provide new evidence about the research or application regarding to the main topics. Articles accepted in this category will be published in the proceedings of the event. Long papers must not exceed 12 pages (including figures and appendices).

This means that me, and the other two co-authors, will be sent to CÃ³rdoba, Spain to present our results. Me and the other authors are currently in the process of making final revisions to the paper,
in preparation for sending in a camera-ready version. 

There will probably be another post detailing our trip, and a link to the conference proceedings.
