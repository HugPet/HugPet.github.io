Yesterday we came back from Spain!

The presentation went very well, and the trip was very fun.
UCAmI took place in C칩rdoba. The highlights of C칩rdoba were the [Mezquita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque%E2%80%93Cathedral_of_C%C3%B3rdoba), [Alc치zar de los Reyes Cristianos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alc%C3%A1zar_de_los_Reyes_Cristianos), and [Taberna Salinas](https://tabernasalinas.com/).

After C칩rdoba we spent a day in Malaga, followed by a day in Gibraltar.
In Malaga we went to the Picasso museum, and I learned a lot of cool 
things about Picasso. I didn't know that he inspired the use of white
pigeons as a symbol of peace. 

In Gibraltar we saw Africa from the point of Gibraltar, and travelled
via cable car to the point of Gibraltar. While on the mountain we saw
a lot of monkeys, walked on a suspension bridge, and walked up a lot of
stairs.
