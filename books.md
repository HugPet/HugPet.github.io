Here are some books I've read recently, and a short bit about what I thought of them.

## The Metamorphosis, In the Penal Colony, The Judgement: A Story for F - Franz Kafka
#### publ. 1913, 1913, 1919, read 2022-11

This book consists of three short stories in one collection.

## Cibola Burn - James S. A. Corey
#### publ. 2014, read 2022-11
<img class="bookimg" src="/img/books/CIB.jpg">

Fourth one down. 

I still like the series, although I've identified some issues for me personally.
- I wish the books were less episodic. Maybe this is something that changes in later books, but as it is now, every book introduces
an immediate threat, and then neatly resolves that threat. 
- At least with this last book, I felt that some of the threats were beginning to feel too large and too many. Maybe this is by design,
but for me it lead to it feeling excessive and unfocused.

Otherwise I felt that the book was good, the plot is interesting and moves at a quick pace, which is nice considering that
I see these books almost as the book-equivalent of popcorn movies.

## Abaddon's Gate - James S. A. Corey
#### publ. 2013, read 2022-10
<img class="bookimg" src="/img/books/ABG.jpg">

*"Optimism expressed as conservation of delta V."*

The third entry to the Expanse series. 
I'm a sucker for stories about precursors and made-up histories of made-up peoples, and this book delivered that in spades. 

Something I like about the series so far is that every subsequent book tries to both expand the scope and introduce new 
perspectives. The first book focused a lot on the noir-vibe, and the second focused more on the political aspect. This book
introduces a new character, a priest, and wants to, sort of, answer the question of what belief in God means in a universe with
aliens in it. I also think Corey balances well the tightrope between having real consequences for characters, while also keeping
enough important characters alive that the reader grows attached to them. It sometimes verges on the unbelievable, but I still
think it is quite good.


## Caliban's War - James S. A. Corey
#### publ. 2012, read 2022-09
<img class="bookimg" src="/img/books/CAW.jpg">

*"We're all traitors now."*

An exciting sequel that properly establishes the scope of the series. 
It has a little bit less noir, and a little bit more political intrigue. I think what I appreciated most in this book was the way that it further fleshed out the world that the characters inhabit. We get a better look into the socio-politics of Earth and Mars, and more of an inside look into how they treat Belters (people who live in the [Jovian system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Jupiter)).

I appreciate Corey's commitment to making varied characters, something that was seen in Leviathan Wakes as well. All four of the point-of-view characters in this book have very different outlooks on life, and changing point of view feels substantial.

## Leviathan Wakes - James S. A. Corey
#### publ. 2011, read 2022-09

*"Compared to the whole, it seemed no larger than a toe, a little finger. It was Captain Darren's head."*

The first book in The Exapnse series, an interesting blend of sci-fi, noir and horror. 
What I liked most about this book was the two point-of-view characters. Holden and Miller
are appealing characters in their own rights, but together they create a nice contrast
between idealism and cynisism. I also found the book surprisingly heart warming at times,
which I thought was very nice. I generally dislike books that are overly pesimistic.

I think this is a promising start to the series, and I am excited to continue reading.

## Ronja Rövardotter - Astrid Lindgren
#### publ. 1981, read 2022-06
<img class="bookimg" src="/img/books/RRD.jpg">

*"Men han fattas mej, skrek Mattis. Han fattas mej så det skär i bröstet!"*

A Swedish classic! I was raised on Astrid Lindgren's books, and the movie adaptations of
her books. This book is a tale inspired by Romeo and Juliet, about two opposing bandit
clans, Mattisrövarna and Borkarövarna, sharing a fort.  

What I appreciate most about this book is how emotional everyone is: *"Hon är vacker
som en liten vittra, håll med om det! Lika smidig, lika mörkögd och lika svarthårig. 
Ni har aldrig sett maken till gran unge, håll med om det!* - Mattis, to a newborn Ronja.
It is refreshing that a masculine character like the chieftain of a bandit clan can show
genuine vulnerability.

## One Hundred Years of Solitude - Gabriel García Márquez
#### publ. 1970, read 2022-06
<img class="bookimg" src="/img/books/YOS.jpg" />

*"[...] he was unable to bear in his soul the crushing weight of so much past."*

The first book I've read that belonged to the genre of magical realism, and what an amazing book it is.
When I read One Hundred Years of Solitude, the themes that stood out to me most were the passage of time
and nostalgia. Gabriel Garcìa Màrquez has crafted such a convincing family and village, where every person
has unique desires and goals.

Something that I really liked about the book was its ability to convey the passage of time, and how
it is never portrayed as a straight line. The Buendía family tackle numerous setbacks, among them
a downpour that didn't stop for several years and an insomniac plague.

## Lords and Ladies - Terry Pratchett
#### publ. 1992, read 2022-05
<img class="bookimg" src="/img/books/LAL.jpg" />

*“If cats looked like frogs we'd realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That's what people remember.”*

The thirteenth book in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series. I really appreciate how optimistic, joyful, and funny Terry Pratchett's books are.
For me they are the ultimate 'comfort food' books, easy to read and easy to enjoy. 

This book is about mythology, in the same way that 'Small Gods' is about religion. Terry Pratchett does a good job
of exploring mythological concepts in a way that feels fresh.
With this entry specifically I really enjoyed the character development. Terry Pratchett has a way of making characters
that simultaneously feel grounded and utterly fantastical.

## Slaughterhouse Five - Kurt Vonnegut
#### publ. 1969, read 2022-05
<img class="bookimg" src="/img/books/SL5.jpg" />

*“And so it goes...”*

An antiwar book about the bombing of Dresden, where almost twenty-five thousand people were killed. Kurt Vonnegut, the author, was present for the bombing.
The book is partly him coming to terms with the war. The book follows Billy Pilgrim, an American soldier in the second world war. It is told by an unreliable narrator,
in a non-linear order. 

The story features a lot of science-fiction elements. At first I was thrown off by this, thinking that this book was to be a more 'realistic' depiction of the war.
After having read it I think that the science-fiction elements serve to underline the cruelty of the war.
